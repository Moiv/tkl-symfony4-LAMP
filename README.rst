LAMP Stack - Web Stack (MySQL) With Symfony 4 Framework
=======================================================

LAMP stack is a popular open source web platform commonly used to run
dynamic web sites and servers. It includes Linux, Apache, MariaDB (MySQL
drop-in replacement), and PHP/Python/Perl. It is considered by many, as
the platform of choice for development and deployment of high performance
web applications which require a solid and reliable foundation.

LAMP stack includes all the standard features in `TurnKey Core`_, and on
top of that:

- SSL support out of the box.
- PHP 7.2, Python and Perl support for Apache2 and MySQL (MariaDB).
- PHP development helpers

    - `php-xdebug`_: debugging and profiling
    - `php-pear`_: php extension and application repository
    - php-cli: command-line interpreter

- `Adminer`_ administration frontend for MySQL (MariaDB) (listening on port
  12322 - uses SSL).
- `Postfix`_ MTA (bound to localhost) to allow sending of email from web
  applications (e.g., password recovery).
- Webmin modules for configuring Apache2, PHP, MySQL and Postfix.
